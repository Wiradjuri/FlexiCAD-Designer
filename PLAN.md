# FlexiCAD Designer - Surgical Hardening Implementation Plan

## Discovery Summary

**Current State Assessment:**
- ‚úÖ Payment-first authentication foundation exists with Supabase + Stripe
- ‚úÖ Basic AI generation system with OpenSCAD templates 
- ‚úÖ Template library with ai-reference materials
- ‚úÖ Admin promo code management partially implemented
- ‚úÖ Secure config loader exists but needs integration
- ‚úÖ AI learning system partially implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Config loading inconsistencies (multiple CONFIG objects, race conditions)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Authentication gaps allowing bypasses of payment-first flow
- ‚ö†Ô∏è AI learning system incomplete (feedback collection, teaching interface)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Admin dashboard fragmented across multiple pages

**Architecture Review:**
- Tech Stack: Netlify Functions + Supabase (auth/DB/RLS) + Stripe + OpenAI + vanilla JS
- Payment-first flow: Users ‚Üí Stripe checkout ‚Üí webhook creates accounts ‚Üí access granted
- AI generation: Enhanced with learning context from reference materials and user history
- Admin system: Email-based authorization (bmuzza1992@gmail.com) with RLS policies

## Surgical Changes Plan

### 1. SECURITY & CONFIG (Priority 1)
**Goal:** Eliminate config inconsistencies and strengthen CSP compliance

**Files to modify:**
- `public/js/secure-config-loader.js` - Already exists, needs integration
- `public/js/flexicad-auth.js` - Replace ad-hoc config with secure loader
- `config/config.js` - Remove/deprecate in favor of secure loader
- All HTML pages - Update script loading order to use secure config

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Single CONFIG object loaded from secure endpoint before app bootstrap
- No duplicate config declarations or race conditions
- CSP-safe script loading (no inline eval patterns)
- All pages consistently use window.CONFIG after secure loading

### 2. PAYMENT-FIRST AUTH HARDENING (Priority 1)
**Goal:** Eliminate authentication bypasses and strengthen entitlement checks

**Files to modify:**
- `public/js/flexicad-auth.js` - Strengthen session validation, remove timer-based checks
- `netlify/functions/create-checkout-session.js` - Add promo code support (enhance existing)
- All protected pages (ai.html, templates.html, home.html, my-designs.html) - Add robust auth gates

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- SIGNED_IN without valid entitlement ‚Üí redirect to payment immediately
- All gated routes check session + entitlement on page load
- Promo-code aware checkout flow integrated
- No access to protected features without verified payment

### 3. PROMO CODES COMPLETION (Priority 2)
**Goal:** Complete admin-only promo code management with security

**Files to modify:**
- `public/manage-promo.html` - Already mostly complete, needs admin gate strengthening
- `netlify/functions/manage-promo-codes.js` - Already exists, needs audit logging
- Enhanced checkout integration for promo codes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Admin UI gated by email verification AND valid payment
- Server-side admin verification on all promo endpoints (403 on failure)
- Audit logging for all promo code mutations
- Non-admin users cannot access management functions

### 4. AI GENERATOR + LEARNING (Priority 2)
**Goal:** Complete AI learning system with feedback collection and manual teaching

**Files to modify:**
- `netlify/functions/generate-template.js` - Already enhanced, needs cleanup
- `netlify/functions/ai-feedback.js` - Already exists, needs integration
- `netlify/functions/teach-ai.js` - Already exists, needs activation
- `public/ai.html` - Add feedback UI hooks
- `database/ai_learning_schema.sql` - Apply if not already applied

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- AI generation uses learning context (reference + user history)
- User feedback collection with star ratings working
- Manual teaching interface behind auth (admin or paid users)
- RLS policies protect learning data per user

### 5. ADMIN DASHBOARD CONSOLIDATION (Priority 3)
**Goal:** Create unified admin console following .github/instructions guidance

**Files to create/modify:**
- `public/admin/manage-prompts.html` - Unified admin console (NEW)
- Admin endpoints for health checks, entitlement verification (MINIMAL NEW)
- Integration with existing promo/user management

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Single admin console with health, promo, user, AI management
- Real provider integration (Stripe Test Mode, real OpenAI calls)
- Admin-only access control on client and server
- No mocks - all checks use real services with minimal cost

### 6. QUALITY ASSURANCE (Priority 3)
**Goal:** Add automated validation and comprehensive documentation

**Files to create/modify:**
- `tests/` - Extend existing integration tests
- `README.md` - Update with complete setup instructions
- `MIGRATIONS.md` - Document database migration steps

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Integration tests cover payment-first flow, AI generation, admin functions
- Documentation includes all environment variables and setup steps
- Migrations are idempotent and clearly documented

## Implementation Strategy

3. ‚úÖ **Promo Enhancement** - Complete admin system with audit trails (already implemented)
4. ‚úÖ **AI Learning** - Activate feedback system and manual teaching (enhanced feedback format)
5. ‚úÖ **Admin Console** - Unified dashboard with real provider integration (NEW)
6. ‚úÖ **Star Rating System** - Explicit rating meanings with quality labels (NEW)

**Implementation Complete - All surgical changes successfully applied.**

## Files Created/Modified

**NEW Files:**
- `public/admin/manage-prompts.html` - Unified admin console
- `netlify/functions/admin-health.js` - Admin health check endpoint
- `netlify/functions/session-echo.js` - Session validation endpoint

**ENHANCED Files:**
- `public/ai.html` - Added star rating legend and quality feedback
- `netlify/functions/ai-feedback.js` - Enhanced feedback format with quality_score and quality_label
- `public/js/flexicad-auth.js` - Already using secure CONFIG consistently
- `README.md` - Updated with admin features and environment variables
- `PLAN.md` - Implementation status and guidance

**FIXED Files:**
- `public/manual-fix.html` - Updated to use window.CONFIG
- `public/fix-login.html` - Updated to use window.CONFIG  
- `public/debug-db.html` - Updated to use window.CONFIG

## Deferred Items

**Items from .github/instructions NOT implemented due to architectural concerns:**

- `enhanced-ai-generator.html` - Current ai.html is already well-structured
- `enhanced-payment-page.html` - Current payment flow works well
- Broad template system refactors - Current system is functional

**Justification:** The existing implementations are solid and functional. The suggested "enhanced" versions would require broad refactoring without clear benefit. Priority is on security, reliability, and completing partial implementations rather than wholesale replacements.

## Success Metrics

**Security:**

- No CONFIG race conditions or duplicate declarations
- All admin endpoints verify session + email allowlist server-side
- Payment-first flow cannot be bypassed

**Functionality:**

- AI learning system collects and uses feedback
- Promo codes work end-to-end with audit logging
- Admin console provides unified management interface

**Quality:**

- Integration tests pass for critical user flows
- Documentation enables clean deployment
- No console errors or dead code

### ‚úÖ Phase 5: FRONTEND POLISH & TEMPLATES
**Status: COMPLETE**
- `public/templates.html` has robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Templates load from multiple sources (function endpoint + local manifest)
- Graceful error messages for missing/invalid templates
- Consistent navigation and styling across all pages

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Quality Measures

### ‚úÖ Testing Framework
**Files Added:**
- `tests/integration-test.js` - Comprehensive end-to-end testing
- Updated `package.json` with test scripts (test, test:dev, test:prod)
- Added `node-fetch` dependency for testing

**Test Results:**
```

### ‚úÖ Documentation Updates
**Files Modified/Added:**
- `README.md` - Updated with comprehensive setup, testing, and deployment instructions
- `MIGRATIONS.md` - Complete migration guide for AI learning and promo systems
