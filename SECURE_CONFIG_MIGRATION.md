# 🔒 Secure Configuration System

## Overview
FlexiCAD Designer now uses a **completely secure server-side configuration system** that eliminates the security risk of exposing API keys in public files.

## How It Works

### ❌ Old System (INSECURE)
- Config files in `/public/config/config.js` 
- **Anyone could visit**: `https://yoursite.com/config/config.js`
- **Exposed sensitive API keys** to the entire internet
- Required complex build-time injection with risk of committing secrets

### ✅ New System (SECURE)
- Configuration served from secure endpoint: `/.netlify/functions/get-public-config`
- **Public directory protection**: `/config/*` blocked with 404 redirects
- **Server-side only**: API keys never touch public files
- **Runtime loading**: Configuration loaded securely when needed

## Security Features

1. **🚫 Directory Blocking**: Netlify redirects block all `/config/*` access
2. **🔒 Server-Side Serving**: Configuration served from protected function
3. **🛡️ No Public Exposure**: Zero chance of accidentally exposing API keys
4. **🔄 Runtime Loading**: Client loads config securely when app starts
5. **📝 No Build Required**: No build-time injection means no secrets in build logs

## Implementation Details

### Client-Side Loading
```javascript
// Automatic secure loading
<script src="js/secure-config-loader.js"></script>

// Configuration available after loading
window.CONFIG.SUPABASE_URL  // ✅ Loaded securely
```

### Server Endpoint
- **URL**: `/.netlify/functions/get-public-config`
- **Method**: GET
- **Response**: JSON with public configuration only
- **Security**: Only exposes client-safe values (no service keys)

### Protected Values
These are **NEVER** exposed to clients:
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Any other secret keys

### Exposed Values (Safe for Clients)
These are safely exposed as needed:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (designed to be public)
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (designed to be public)
- App configuration (non-sensitive)

## Migration Complete ✅

- ✅ Removed insecure `/public/config/config.js`
- ✅ All HTML files use `secure-config-loader.js`
- ✅ Netlify redirects block config directory access
- ✅ Build scripts updated (no longer needed)
- ✅ Security headers implemented
- ✅ Configuration endpoint tested and working

## Testing Security

```bash
# ✅ This works (secure endpoint)
curl https://yoursite.com/.netlify/functions/get-public-config

# ❌ This is blocked (404 error)
curl https://yoursite.com/config/config.js

# ❌ These are also blocked
curl https://yoursite.com/config/anything.js
curl https://yoursite.com/.env
```

Your API keys are now **completely secure** and can never be accidentally exposed! 🔒
