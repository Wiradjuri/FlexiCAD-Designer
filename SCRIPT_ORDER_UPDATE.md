# FlexiCAD Authentication Script Loading Order - Update Summary

## Changes Applied

All HTML entry files in `/public` that use authentication have been updated to ensure consistent script loading order.

### ✅ Updated Files:

1. **index.html** - Main login/register page
2. **login.html** - Dedicated login page  
3. **register.html** - Dedicated register page
4. **home.html** - User home dashboard
5. **ai.html** - AI design generation page
6. **my-designs.html** - User designs management
7. **templates.html** - Template browsing page
8. **payment-first-verification.html** - Payment system testing
9. **auth-system-test.html** - Authentication system testing

### ✅ Script Loading Order Applied:

At the bottom of `<body>`, before closing `</body>`:

```html
<script src="config/env-config.js"></script>
<script src="config/config.js"></script>
<script src="js/flexicad-auth.js"></script>
```

### ✅ Issues Fixed:

1. **Removed Duplicates**: Eliminated duplicate script inclusions (multiple config.js, Supabase libraries)
2. **Consistent Order**: Ensured env-config.js loads before config.js on all pages
3. **Clean Head Sections**: Removed config.js from `<head>` sections to prevent loading conflicts
4. **Removed Obsolete Scripts**: Removed js/supabase-client.js references as per user requirements

### ✅ Script Dependencies Maintained:

- **env-config.js** → Loads first (sets up environment variables)
- **config.js** → Loads second (uses environment variables)
- **flexicad-auth.js** → Loads third (uses config for authentication)

### ✅ External Libraries Preserved:

The following external scripts remain where needed but were not modified:
- Supabase CDN (https://unpkg.com/@supabase/supabase-js@2)
- Stripe.js (register.html only)
- Marked.js (templates.html only)

### ✅ Pages Not Modified:

The following pages do not use authentication and were left unchanged:
- about.html
- payment-success.html
- Various test files that don't use the core auth system

## Verification

All HTML entry files now have consistent script loading order:
1. Environment configuration loads first
2. Application configuration loads second  
3. Authentication system loads third

This ensures proper initialization sequence and eliminates script loading conflicts.
