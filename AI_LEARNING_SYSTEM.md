- Builds expertise over time

### üìä **User Feedback System**
- Star rating system (1-5 stars) for each generation
- Optional text feedback for improvements
- Code correction tracking when users modify generated code
- Automatic knowledge base updates from high-quality feedback

### üéì **Manual Teaching Interface**
- Users can manually add training examples
- Categorize patterns by type and complexity
- Add keywords and descriptions for better matching
- Contribute to the collective AI knowledge

### üîç **Smart Pattern Matching**
- Finds similar patterns from past successes
- Uses keyword matching and user history
- Contextualizes prompts with relevant examples
- Adapts to user preferences over time

### Database Schema

#### Tables Created
1. **`ai_learning_sessions`** - Stores all AI generations and feedback
2. **`ai_knowledge_base`** - Successful patterns for future reference
3. **`ai_corrections`** - User modifications and improvements

#### Key Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) for user privacy
- Automatic triggers for knowledge base updates
- Indexed for fast pattern matching
- User history tracking

### Frontend Interface

#### AI Generator Page (`ai.html`)
- **Rating System**: 5-star feedback after each generation
- **Feedback Form**: Optional text feedback and code corrections
- **Teaching Interface**: Manual pattern addition for high-rated results
- **Metadata Display**: Shows generation context and performance

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor:
-- (See database/setup_ai_learning.sql for full script)
```

### 2. Training Data
- Existing training data in `ai-reference/` folder is automatically loaded
- `ai_training_data.json` - Core training examples
- `enhanced_manifest.json` - Advanced patterns
- `examples.json` - Code examples

### 3. Environment Variables
All existing environment variables work with the enhanced system:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI generation
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Database connection
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Database operations

## Usage

### For Users

#### 1. Generate Design
- Enter prompt as usual
- AI now uses learned patterns and your history
- Get better results based on collective knowledge

#### 2. Rate Generation
- Use the 5-star rating system
- Provide optional feedback
- Submit code improvements

#### 3. Teach the AI
- For highly-rated results, option to "Teach AI"
- Add pattern to knowledge base
- Help improve future generations

### For Administrators

#### Manual Teaching
```javascript
// Add training pattern via API
POST /.netlify/functions/teach-ai
{
  "patternName": "Phone Case with Cutouts",
  "description": "Protective case with camera cutouts",
  "keywords": ["phone", "case", "cutout", "camera"],
  "examplePrompt": "Create a phone case for iPhone 14",
  "successfulCode": "/* OpenSCAD code */",
  "category": "functional",
  "complexityLevel": "intermediate"
}
```

## Learning Process

### 1. **Pattern Recognition**
- When user enters a prompt, system searches for similar patterns
- Uses keyword matching and semantic similarity
- Includes user's previous successful generations

### 2. **Context Building**
- Builds enhanced system prompt with:
  - Similar patterns from knowledge base
  - User's successful history
  - Best practices from training data
  - Specific techniques for the request type

### 3. **Feedback Loop**
- Users rate generations (1-5 stars)
- High-rated generations (4-5) automatically added to knowledge base
- User corrections tracked for common mistake patterns
- System continuously improves

### 4. **Knowledge Evolution**
- Patterns get usage counts and average ratings
- Most successful patterns prioritized
- Bad patterns filtered out over time
- User-specific learning from history

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks:
- **Generation Quality**: Average user ratings
- **Pattern Usage**: How often patterns are referenced  
- **Learning Rate**: Knowledge base growth over time
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback trends and improvements

## Security

- All learning data is protected by RLS policies
- Users can only see their own sessions and corrections
- Knowledge base is readable by paid users only
- Service role required for knowledge base modifications

## API Endpoints

### Learning Functions
- `POST /.netlify/functions/generate-template` - Enhanced generation with learning
- `POST /.netlify/functions/ai-feedback` - Submit feedback and ratings
- `POST /.netlify/functions/teach-ai` - Manual teaching interface

### Response Format
```javascript
// Enhanced generation response includes metadata
{
  "code": "// Generated OpenSCAD code",
  "prompt": "User's original prompt",
  "name": "Design name",
  "metadata": {
    "category": "functional",
    "complexity": "intermediate", 
    "similarPatterns": 3,
    "userExamples": 2,
    "generationTime": 1500,
    "tokensUsed": 800,
    "sessionId": "unique-session-id"
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Pattern Matching**: Vector similarity search
2. **User Clustering**: Group users with similar preferences
3. **Code Quality Analysis**: Automatic syntax and style checking
4. **Performance Optimization**: Cache frequently used patterns
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Admin interface for learning insights

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Learning Not Working**
   - Verify database tables are created (`database/setup_ai_learning.sql`)
   - Check RLS policies are enabled
   - Confirm service role key is configured

2. **Patterns Not Loading**
   - Check `ai-reference/` folder exists and contains training files
   - Verify file permissions for serverless functions
   - Look at function logs for loading errors

3. **Feedback Not Saving**
   - Confirm user authentication is working
   - Check session ID is being passed correctly
   - Verify database connection and permissions
